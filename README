# Open Library Management System

This Readme file itself is still under development, I hope to update this as soon as possible. In a nutshell, I'm trying to develop an open source library management system.

In the future this project is most likely to be divided into several smaller ones if it seems necessary.

## Server

Handles basic library functions and also generates pdf reports when necessary. Feature set still needs to be finalized. Going to implement using:

 * Node.js
 * MySQL

## Clients

The operating system which is going to be used by the library clients. Users are allowed to visit only a few selected websites in addition to the library system where they can read/download ebooks. Going to implement using:

 * Slitaz GNU Linux
 * Mozilla Chromeless
